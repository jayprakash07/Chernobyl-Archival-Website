Chernobyl Helicopter Video:

The Ukrainian filmmaker Vladimir Shevchenko captured film footage of an Mi-8 helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby construction crane cable resulting in the death of its four-man crew. The photo of the helicopter's crew shown in the video clip below was taken by Igor Kostin the day before the crash.
