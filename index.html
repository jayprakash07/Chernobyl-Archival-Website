                            Chernobyl, a city located in northern Ukraine, is famous for the nuclear disaster that
                            occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26, 1986. The disaster is known as
                            the worst nuclear accident in history, causing severe and long-lasting effects on the
                            environment and human health.
                        </p>
                        <p class="w-90 sm-w-100 m-25px-b">
                            During a routine test of the power plant's fourth reactor, a combination of design flaws and
                            operator error caused the reactor's core to overheat, leading to a steam explosion and a
                            fire that lasted for several days. The fire released radioactive particles into the air,
                            which spread over large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
                        </p>
                        <p class="w-90 sm-w-100 m-25px-b">
                            The initial response to the accident was inadequate, as the Soviet government attempted to
                            downplay the severity of the disaster. It wasn't until several days later that residents of
                            nearby towns were evacuated, and cleanup efforts began. In the years following the disaster,
                            a 30-kilometer exclusion zone was established around the power plant, and the Soviet Union
                            implemented stricter safety measures for nuclear power plants.
                        </p>

                            The Chernobyl disaster had a significant impact on the environment and human health. The
                            radioactive particles released during the explosion contaminated large areas of land and
                            water, making them uninhabitable. Thousands of people were exposed to high levels of
                            radiation, and many developed long-term health problems such as cancer and thyroid
                            disease.

                            Today, Chernobyl is mostly uninhabited, except for a few workers who maintain the
                            power plant and tourists who visit the area. The disaster is a reminder of the potential
                            dangers of nuclear power and the importance of safety measures to prevent accidents.

                            Discussions take place in Kiev about the type of nuclear plant to be built at Chernobyl.
                            Deputy Chief Engineer at Chernobyl, Grigori Medvedev, proposes construction of Pressurized
                            Water Reactors (PWRs). He informs the Ukraine Minister of Energy, Aleksei Makukhin, that an
                            RBMK (a boiling water reactor) releases forty times more radiation than a PWR. The scientist
                            Alekzandrov opposes this, saying that the RBMK- 1000 was not only the safest reactor, but it
                            also produced the cheapest electricity as well. For this reason it was decided to build the
                            RBMK pressure tube reactors.

                            Dyatlov ordered reactor cooling with emergency speed, assuming the reactor was intact and
                            the explosion had been caused by hydrogen accumulating in the emergency tank of the safety
                            control system. Other employees went to the control room, reporting damage. Dyatlov went to
                            the backup control room, pressing the AZ-5 button there and disconnecting power to the
                            control rod servo drives; despite seeing the graphite blocks scattered on the ground outside
                            the plant, he still believed the reactor was intact. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned
                            to report the reactor damage they had seen, but Dyatlov insisted what they had seen was the
                            results of an explosion of the emergency tank, claiming the explosion of the 110m³ tank at
                            Level +71 was sufficient to destroy the central hall roof. Dyatlov reported his assumptions
                            as reality to Bryukhanov and Fomin, the higher-level managers. In the corridor, he met
                            Genrikh and Kurguz and sent them to the medical station. He ran to the control room of Block
                            3, ordered Bagdasarov to shut down Reactor 3, then returned to control room 4 and ordered
                            Akimov to call the daytime shift and get people to the affected unit; namely Lelechenko,
                            whose crew had to remove hydrogen from the Generator 8 electrolyzer.

                            Aleksandr Kudryavtsev and Viktor Proskuryakov, the SIUR trainees from other shifts, were
                            present to watch Toptunov and learn. After the explosion they were sent by Dyatlov or Akimov
                            to the central hall to turn the handles of the system for manually lowering of the
                            presumably seized control rods. They ran through the deaerator gallery to the right to the
                            VRSO unit elevator, found it destroyed, so climbed up the staircase instead, towards Level
                            36; they missed Kurguz and Genrikh, who used another stairwell. Level 36 was destroyed,
                            covered with rubble. They went through a narrow corridor towards the central hall, entered
                            the reactor hall, and found it blocked with rubble and fragments; dangling fire hoses were
                            pouring water into the remains of the reactor core, the firemen not there anymore. The Upper
                            Biological Shield was slanted, jammed into the reactor shaft; a blue and red fire raged in
                            the hole. The minute the two stood above the reactor was enough to darken their bodies with
                            “nuclear tan” and give them a fatal radiation dose. They returned to Level 10 and to the
                            control room, reporting the situation; Dyatlov insisted they were wrong, the explosion had
                            been caused by hydrogen-oxygen mixture in the 110m³ emergency tank and the reactor itself
                            was intact.

                            destruction of the reactor building from the broken windows of the deaerator gallery. With
                            his face already tanned by the radiation, he went to the dosimetry room and asked
                            Gorbachenko for radiation levels; Gorbachenko left with Palamarchuk to rescue Shashenok
                            while Perevozchenko went through the graphite and fuel containing radioactive rubble on
                            Level 10 to the remains of Room 306 in an unsuccessful attempt to locate Khodemchuk, close
                            to debris emitting over 10,000 roentgens per hour (90 µA/kg). He then went to the control

                            burning around them. Palamarchuk unsuccessfully attempted to contact Sashenok in Room 604,
                            then ran around the turbogenerator 8, down to Level 0 and urged the two men from the Kharkov

                            Alexander Yuvchenko was located in his office between reactors 3 and 4, on Level 12.5; he
                            described the event as a shock wave that buckled walls, blew doors in, and brought a cloud
                            of milky grey radioactive dust and steam. The lights went out. He met a badly burned,
                            drenched and shocked pump operator, who asked him to rescue Khodemchuk; that quickly proved
                            impossible as that part of the building did not exist anymore. Yuvchenko, together with the
                            foreman Yuri Tregub, ran out of the building and saw half of the building gone and the
                            reactor emitting a blue glow of ionized air. They returned to the building and met Valeri
                            Perevozchenko and two junior technicians, Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov, ordered by Dyatlov
                            or Akimov to manually lower the presumably seized control rods. Tregub went to report the
                            extent of damage to the control room. Despite Yuvchenko’s explanation that there were no
                            control rods left, the four climbed a stairwell to Level 35 to survey the damage; Yuvchenko
                            held open the massive door into the reactor room and the other three proceeded in to locate
                            the control rod mechanism; after no more than a minute of surveying the reactor debris,
                            enough for all three to sustain fatal doses of radiation, they returned, their skin darkened
                            with “nuclear tan” in reaction to the high dose of radiation. The three were the first to
                            die in the Moscow hospital. Yuvchenko meanwhile suffered serious beta burns and gamma burns
                            to his left shoulder, hip and calf as he kept the radioactive-dust-covered door open. It was
                            later estimated he received a dose of 4.1 Sv. At 03:00, he began vomiting intensely; by
                            06:00, he could no longer walk. He later spent a year in the Moscow hospital receiving blood
                            and plasma transfusions and received numerous skin grafts.

                            We arrived there at 10 or 15 minutes to two in the morning… We saw graphite scattered about.
                            Misha asked: “Is that graphite?” I kicked it away. But one of the fighters on the other
                            truck picked it up. “It’s hot,” he said. The pieces of graphite were of different sizes,
                            some big, some small, enough to pick them up…

                            We didn’t know much about radiation. Even those who worked there had no idea. There was no
                            water left in the trucks. Misha filled a cistern and we aimed the water at the top. Then
                            those boys who died went up to the roof – Vashchik, Kolya and others, and Volodya Pravik….
                            They went up the ladder … and I never saw them again.

                            aware of the risks.



                            Of course we knew! If we’d followed regulations, we would never have gone near the reactor.
                            But it was a moral obligation – our duty. We were like kamikaze.

                            explosion. To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the water table below the
                            reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the
                            reactor, which would also stabilise the foundations. Using oil drilling equipment, the
                            injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May. It was estimated that 25 metric tons of liquid
                            nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at −100 °C. This idea was soon
                            scrapped and the room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with

                            cover whatever could be the source of further radioactive discharges. A shelter had to be
                            built. It was another matter, what kind of shelter. But covering it was a must.

                            is extremely high. Sweden also increases their limit to 1500Bq/kg from 300Bq/kg in May 1987.
                            Most countries have a limit of 600 Bq/kg. And even this figure is heavily criticised. But
                            due to this limit much of the reindeer meat can be sold in Scandinavian countries.

                            A fire breaks out in the turbine hall of Reactor 2. The fire began in Turbine 4 while it was
                            idle for repairs. A faulty switch caused a surge of current to the turbine, igniting
                            insulating material on some electrical wiring.This subsequently led to a leak of hydrogen,
                            used as a turbine coolant, into the turbine hall which created the conditions for fire to
                            start in the roof and for one of the trusses supporting the roof to collapse.

                                                After the explosion, the nuclear power station was covered in radioactive dust. 
                                                Aircraft and helicopters flew over the site, spraying sticky decontamination fluid that fixed the radiation to the ground. 
                                                Workers known as 'liquidators' then rolled the dried remains like a carpet and buried the nuclear waste.

                                                This was taken from the first helicopter to fly over the disaster zone to evaluate radiation levels. 
                                                The view is foggy due to radiation, which also explains why the shot was not taken too close to the window. 
                                                Later, radiation experts learnt that at 200 metres above the reactor, levels reached 1500 rems, despite the fact that their counters did not exceed 500 rems.

                                                The majority of liquidators were men called up from military reserves because of their experience in clean-up operations or chemical protection units. The army did not have adequate uniforms for use in radioactive conditions, so those enlisted had to cobble together their own clothing made from lead sheets measuring 2-4mm thick. These sheets were cut to size to make aprons covering their bodies in front and behind, especially to protect the spine and bone marrow. 'The clever ones also added a vine leaf for extra comfort,' said Kostin.

                                                Liquidators clean the roof of reactor 3. Initially, workers tried clearing the radioactive debris using West German, Japanese and Russian robots, but they could not cope with the extreme radiation levels, so the authorities decided to use humans. Employees could not stay any longer than 40 seconds any one time, before the radiation dose they received reached the maximum a human should receive in his entire life. Many liquidators have since died or suffer from severe health problems.

                                                The majority of liquidators were men called up from military reserves because of their experience in clean-up operations or chemical protection units. The army did not have adequate uniforms for use in radioactive conditions, so those enlisted had to cobble together their own clothing made from lead sheets measuring 2-4mm thick. These sheets were cut to size to make aprons covering their bodies in front and behind, especially to protect the spine and bone marrow. 'The clever ones also added a vine leaf for extra comfort,' said Kostin.

                                                To mark the end of the clean-up operation atop reactor 3, the authorities ordered three men to attach a red flag to the summit of the chimney. A group of liquidators had already made two fruitless attempts by helicopter, so the three men had to climb the 78 metre chimney via a spiral staircase, despite the dangerous radiation levels. Radiation expert Alexander Yourtchenko carried the pole, followed by Valéri Starodoumov with the flag, while lieutenant-colonel Alexander Sotnikov ascended with the radio. The whole operation was timed to last only 9 minutes given the high radiation levels. At then end, the trio were rewarded with a bottle of Pepsi (a luxury in 1986) and a day off.

It was located 7km from the Chernobyl reactor that housed the control room and decontamination area in the months after the disaster. A bulldozer would dig a large trench in front of each house before burying the building and covering it with earth and flattening the soil. Entire villages would be buried this way.

Due to its contamination by plutonium isotopes, Pripyat cannot be inhabited for another 24,000 years. It was built to house Chernobyl workers in the 1970s, and was one of the youngest towns in the USSR with an average age of 26. Other unofficial evacuations also took place including in Kiev, where children were reported to have been put on trains in great numbers.

Liquidator friends contacted Kostin, who immediately visited the site accompanied by his wife, Alla, who, too worried to stay at home, spent the whole night at a control post as she was not authorised to enter. The roof was blown off but, fortunately, there was no radioactive leak.

Some 1,350 Soviet military helicopters, buses, bulldozers, tankers, transporters, fire engines and ambulances were used while fighting against the April 26, 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl. All were irradiated during the clean-up operation. Thirty years ago, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded in Ukraine, spreading radioactive material across much of the Northern Hemisphere.

                                                In this photo taken on Wednesday, March 23, 2016, a chimney over the destroyed reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, background left, and a gigantic steel-arch under construction to cover the remnants of the exploded reactor, are seen in the town of Prypyat close to Chernobyl, Ukraine. Abandoned houses in the foreground were left by Chernobyl plant workers a few days after the explosion, and since then Prypyat has become the ghost town. Ukraine marks the 30th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear disaster on April 26.

                                                This photo taken Wednesday, March 23, 2016 shows abandoned apartment buildings in the town of Pripyat near Chernobyl, Ukraine, with a chimney, left, at the destroyed reactor and a gigantic arch-shape confinement to cover the remnants of the exploded reactor, in the back, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Thirty years after the world’s worst nuclear accident, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is surrounded by both a hushed desolation and clangorous activity, the sense of a ruined past and a difficult future.
