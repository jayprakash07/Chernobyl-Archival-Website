                            Chernobyl, a city located in northern Ukraine, is famous for the nuclear disaster that
                            occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26, 1986. The disaster is known as
                            the worst nuclear accident in history, causing severe and long-lasting effects on the
                            environment and human health.
                        </p>
                        <p class="w-90 sm-w-100 m-25px-b">
                            During a routine test of the power plant's fourth reactor, a combination of design flaws and
                            operator error caused the reactor's core to overheat, leading to a steam explosion and a
                            fire that lasted for several days. The fire released radioactive particles into the air,
                            which spread over large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
                        </p>
                        <p class="w-90 sm-w-100 m-25px-b">
                            The initial response to the accident was inadequate, as the Soviet government attempted to
                            downplay the severity of the disaster. It wasn't until several days later that residents of
                            nearby towns were evacuated, and cleanup efforts began. In the years following the disaster,
                            a 30-kilometer exclusion zone was established around the power plant, and the Soviet Union
                            implemented stricter safety measures for nuclear power plants.
                        </p>

                            The Chernobyl disaster had a significant impact on the environment and human health. The
                            radioactive particles released during the explosion contaminated large areas of land and
                            water, making them uninhabitable. Thousands of people were exposed to high levels of
                            radiation, and many developed long-term health problems such as cancer and thyroid
                            disease.

                            Today, Chernobyl is mostly uninhabited, except for a few workers who maintain the
                            power plant and tourists who visit the area. The disaster is a reminder of the potential
                            dangers of nuclear power and the importance of safety measures to prevent accidents.

                            On what kind of nuclear plant to erect at Chernobyl, discussions are taking place in Kiev.
                            The development of pressurized water reactors is something that Chernobyl's deputy chief
                            engineer, Grigori Medvedev, suggests (PWRs). He explains that a boiling water reactor (RBMK)
                            emits forty times more radiation than a power generating reactor (PWR), Aleksei Makukhin,
                            the energy minister of Ukraine. Alekzandrov, a physicist, disagrees with this and claims
                            that the RBMK-1000 was not only the safest reactor, but it also generated the cheapest
                            power. The RBMK pressure tube reactors were chosen to be built for this purpose.

                            in the safety control system's emergency tank, Dyatlov ordered reactor cooling at emergency
                            speed. Damage was reported by other staff who proceeded to the control room. Dyatlov, who
                            believed the reactor was still intact despite witnessing the graphite blocks spread on the
                            ground outside the facility, went to the backup control room, pressed the AZ-5 button there,
                            and disconnected power to the control rod servo motors. When Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov
                            returned to report the damage to the reactor they had witnessed, Dyatlov insisted that what
                            they had actually witnessed was the results of an emergency tank explosion, asserting that
                            the 110m3 tank explosion at Level +71 was sufficient to completely destroy the central hall
                            roof. Dyatlov informed the higher-level managers, Bryukhanov and Fomin, that his
                            presumptions were true. He ran into Genrikh and Kurguz in the hallway and sent them to the
                            medical station. Lelechenko's team had to extract hydrogen from the Generator 8
                            electrolyzer, so he hurried to the control room of Block 3 and told Bagdasarov to switch
                            down Reactor 3. He then went back to control room 4 and told Akimov to contact the daylight
                            shift and send employees to the stricken unit.

                            The SIUR trainees from the other shifts, Alexander Kudryavtsev and Viktor Proskuryakov, were
                            there to observe Toptunov and pick up tips. Following the explosion, Dyatlov or Akimov
                            directed them to the central hall to operate the system's handles and manually lower the
                            ostensibly seized control rods. They rushed through the deaerator gallery to the right in
                            search of the VRSO unit elevator, but they discovered it to be broken. As a result, they
                            took the staircase up to Level 36 instead, missing Kurguz and Genrikh who took a different
                            stairway. Level 36 was demolished and covered in debris. They approached the reactor hall
                            after passing through a small passageway leading to the main hall and discovered it
                            obstructed by debris and pieces; hanging fire hoses were pouring water into the reactor
                            core's remnants; and the firemen were no longer present. A blue and crimson fire blazed in
                            the hole where the Upper Biological Shield was wedged into the reactor shaft at an angle.
                            The two just had to stand above the reactor for one minute for a lethal dosage of radiation
                            to colour their bodies with "nuclear tan." They went back to Level 10 and the control room
                            to report the incident, but Dyatlov believed they were mistaken and that the reactor was
                            still in tact since the explosion had been brought on by a hydrogen-oxygen combination in
                            the 110m3 emergency tank.

                            After the explosions, Valeriy Ivanovich Perevozchenko, the foreman of the reactor area,
                            entered the control room before leaving to locate his coworkers. He observed the nuclear
                            building being demolished via the broken windows of the deaerator gallery. After a fruitless
                            attempt to locate Khodemchuk, Perevozchenko ventured through the radioactive debris on Level
                            10 to the remnants of Room 306, near to debris releasing over 10,000 roentgens per hour (90
                            A/kg). Gorbachenko fled with Palamarchuk to save Shashenok. His face was already browned by
                            the radiation when he queried Gorbachenko about radiation levels. He entered the Genrikh and
                            Kurguz control room, which was empty; after passing out and regaining consciousness, he
                            reported the circumstance.

                            Vyacheslav Brazhnik, the senior turbine machinist operator, entered the control room quickly
                            to report the fire in the turbine hall. Razim Davletbayev and Pyotr Palamarchuk, the
                            director of the Chernobyl business group, followed him back to the turbine room. They could
                            see fires on Levels 0 and +12, damaged water and oil pipes, roof debris on top of turbine 7,
                            and scattered pieces of reactor graphite and fuel as well as burning linoleum on the floor.
                            After failing to reach Sashenok in Room 604, Palamarchuk persuaded the two men from the
                            Kharkov mobile laboratory who were charged with documenting the turbine 8 vibrations to
                            leave; unfortunately, by this time, they had both already received a deadly radiation
                            dosage. Afterwards, Palamarchuk dashed through Turbogenerator 8 and reached Level 0. After
                            losing contact with the dosimetry chamber, Akimov gave Palamarchuk the order to look for
                            Gorbachenko before rescuing Sashenok. Palamarchuk and Gorbachenko met at the stairway on
                            Level +27. They uncovered and gathered Shashenok's dead body together.

                            On Level 12.5, between reactors 3 and 4, Alexander Yuvchenko was at his office. He described
                            the incident as a shock wave that blew in doors, cracked walls, and released a cloud of
                            radioactive dust and steam that was a milky grey colour. The lights went off. A pump
                            operator who had been severely burned, submerged, and shocked asked Khodemchuk to save him;
                            this instantly proved to be impossible because that portion of the structure was vanished.
                            As soon as they noticed the reactor producing a blue glow of ionized air and the structure
                            being destroyed in half, Yuvchenko and the foreman, Yuri Tregub, left the building. Once
                            inside, they discovered Valeri Perevozchenko along with Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov, two
                            apprentice technicians who had been tasked by Dyatlov or Akimov to manually lower the
                            purportedly jammed control rods. Tregub went to the control room to let them know how
                            extensive the damage was. When the other three entered to locate the control rod mechanism,
                            Yuvchenko held open the big entrance to the reactor chamber. The four ascended a stairway to
                            Level 35 to assess the damage despite Yuvchenko's assurance that there were no control rods
                            remaining. They returned with skin that had developed a "nuclear tan" as a result of the
                            significant radiation dosage they had all received after less than a minute of scanning the
                            reactor wreckage. These were the hospital in Moscow's first deaths among its patients.
                            Yuvchenko sustained severe beta burns as well as gamma burns to his left shoulder, hip, and
                            calf while keeping the radioactive dust-covered door open. His dose was later calculated to
                            be 4.1 Sv. Around three in the morning, he began violently vomiting up; by six, he was
                            unable to stand. He then endured many skin grafts and spent a year receiving blood and
                            plasma infusions in a hospital in Moscow.

                            One of the fire engines' driver, Grigorii Khmel, later provided the following account of
                            what transpired: "At around 2:00 in the morning, we reached there. We noticed graphite lying
                            everywhere. Is that graphite, Misha questioned? I threw it away with a kick. Nevertheless,
                            one of the combatants on the other truck took it. It's hot, he declared. The graphite bits
                            varied in size, some being large and others being little, making them easy to pick up. We
                            didn't have a lot of radiation knowledge. Even the staff members were unaware. The trucks
                            were completely empty of water. We directed the water at the top of a cistern after Misha
                            filled it. The youths that perished, including Volodya Pravik and Kolya, then climbed onto
                            the roof. They climbed the ladder. I never ran into them again."

                            unharmed. Water was already being continuously fed into the reactor by emergency pump 2 from
                            the deaerators when Fomin gave the command (a machine that is frequently used to filter
                            oxygen and other dissolved gases out of the water used to feed steam boilers). Fomin
                            persisted in pressuring the workers to add water to the reactor and moved additional people
                            to Unit 4 to take the place of those who were becoming radiation-damaged. As Dyatlov left,
                            Fomin gave his successor Sitnikov instructions to ascend to Unit C's roof and inspect the
                            reactor. Sitnikov followed the instructions but was fatally exposed to radiation there; at
                            10:00 he returned and informed Fomin and Bryukhanov that the reactor had been destroyed. The
                            management disregarded him and insisted that water be supplied into the reactor. Water,
                            however, continued to flow down the damaged pipes and into the plant's lower levels,
                            bringing radioactive material and producing short circuits in the electric cableways that
                            connected all four of the blocks.

                                                The majority of liquidators were men called up from military reserves because of their experience in clean-up operations or chemical protection units. The army did not have adequate uniforms for use in radioactive conditions, so those enlisted had to cobble together their own clothing made from lead sheets measuring 2-4mm thick. These sheets were cut to size to make aprons covering their bodies in front and behind, especially to protect the spine and bone marrow. 'The clever ones also added a vine leaf for extra comfort,' said Kostin.

                                                Liquidators clean the roof of reactor 3. Initially, workers tried clearing the radioactive debris using West German, Japanese and Russian robots, but they could not cope with the extreme radiation levels, so the authorities decided to use humans. Employees could not stay any longer than 40 seconds any one time, before the radiation dose they received reached the maximum a human should receive in his entire life. Many liquidators have since died or suffer from severe health problems.

                                                The majority of liquidators were men called up from military reserves because of their experience in clean-up operations or chemical protection units. The army did not have adequate uniforms for use in radioactive conditions, so those enlisted had to cobble together their own clothing made from lead sheets measuring 2-4mm thick. These sheets were cut to size to make aprons covering their bodies in front and behind, especially to protect the spine and bone marrow. 'The clever ones also added a vine leaf for extra comfort,' said Kostin.

                                                To mark the end of the clean-up operation atop reactor 3, the authorities ordered three men to attach a red flag to the summit of the chimney. A group of liquidators had already made two fruitless attempts by helicopter, so the three men had to climb the 78 metre chimney via a spiral staircase, despite the dangerous radiation levels. Radiation expert Alexander Yourtchenko carried the pole, followed by Valéri Starodoumov with the flag, while lieutenant-colonel Alexander Sotnikov ascended with the radio. The whole operation was timed to last only 9 minutes given the high radiation levels. At then end, the trio were rewarded with a bottle of Pepsi (a luxury in 1986) and a day off.

It was located 7km from the Chernobyl reactor that housed the control room and decontamination area in the months after the disaster. A bulldozer would dig a large trench in front of each house before burying the building and covering it with earth and flattening the soil. Entire villages would be buried this way.

Due to its contamination by plutonium isotopes, Pripyat cannot be inhabited for another 24,000 years. It was built to house Chernobyl workers in the 1970s, and was one of the youngest towns in the USSR with an average age of 26. Other unofficial evacuations also took place including in Kiev, where children were reported to have been put on trains in great numbers.

Liquidator friends contacted Kostin, who immediately visited the site accompanied by his wife, Alla, who, too worried to stay at home, spent the whole night at a control post as she was not authorised to enter. The roof was blown off but, fortunately, there was no radioactive leak.

                                                In this Nov. 10, 2000 photo, radioactive contaminated vehicles lay dormant near the Chernobyl nuclear power plan. Some 1,350 Soviet military helicopters, buses, bulldozers, tankers, transporters, fire engines and ambulances were used while fighting against the April 26, 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl. All were irradiated during the clean-up operation. Thirty years ago, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded in Ukraine, spreading radioactive material across much of the Northern Hemisphere.

                            and footage of the Chernobyl disaster are a remarkable group of individuals. Through their
                            work, they have documented one of the most significant nuclear disasters in history, and
                            have provided a glimpse into the devastation and tragedy that resulted.

                            bravery of those who risked their lives to contain the disaster. They have captured the
                            impact of the disaster on the environment and the people who were affected, and their images
                            have served as a reminder of the dangers of nuclear power.

                            images of the damaged reactor and the immediate aftermath of the explosion. His images were
                            among the first to be published worldwide, and they helped raise awareness about the
                            disaster.

                            about the dangers of nuclear power and the importance of nuclear safety. Their images and
                            footage will continue to be an essential part of our history, and a reminder of the impact
