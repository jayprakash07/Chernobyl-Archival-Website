# Contributing to "Remembering Chernobyl: A Digital Exploration of the Tragedy"

Welcome! We are excited to have you contribute to our project. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Getting Started
Before contributing, make sure you have:

A Github account:
 - A basic understanding of Git and Github
 - Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
 - If you are new to Git and Github, check out Github's Getting Started guide and Git's Documentation.
 - Access to reputable sources for historical information related to the Chernobyl disaster.

### How to Contribute
To contribute to the project, follow these steps:

 - Fork the repository to your Github account.
 - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
 - Create a new branch on your local machine.
 - Make your changes or additions to the code, images, or audio files.
 - Test your changes to ensure they work as intended.
 - Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
 - Push your changes to your forked repository.

Create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes into the original repository.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

# Guidelines
Here are some guidelines to follow when contributing to the project:

 - Before making changes or additions, check the issues section of the repository to see if there are any open issues related to your proposed changes. If there is an issue, assign yourself to it and make changes in your local branch.
 - Keep your changes focused and small. If you want to make larger changes  or additions, create an issue in the repository first to discuss it with the project maintainers.
 - Use clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes you made.
 - Use comments in your code to explain what your code does, and why you made certain decisions.
 - Make sure your code follows good coding practices, such as using descriptive variable names, following a consistent code style, and avoiding redundant or unnecessary code.
 - Use images and audio files that are in the public domain or licensed under a Creative Commons license that allows for commercial and derivative use.
 - When adding historical information or quotes, use reputable sources such as academic journals, books, and documentaries. Be sure to include links to your sources in your PR request.
 - When adding images or audio files, provide descriptive alt text or captions for accessibility.
